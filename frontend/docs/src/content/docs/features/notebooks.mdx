# üìö Notebooks

Notebooks are the **foundation of your research organization** in Escruta. They serve as centralized workspaces where you can collect sources, take notes, and organize all materials related to a specific project or topic.

<div class="feature-card">

## üéØ Core Concept

Think of notebooks as **digital research folders** that contain everything related to a particular subject. Each notebook acts as a self-contained workspace where you can upload documents, take notes, have AI conversations, and generate study materials.

</div>

## What are Notebooks?

Notebooks provide a **project-based approach** to research organization. Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Escruta notebooks integrate multiple content types and AI-powered analysis tools in one cohesive workspace.

### Key Capabilities

## Creating Your First Notebook

### üÜï Creating a New Notebook

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: From your main dashboard, locate the notebook section
2. **Click "New Notebook"**: Use the prominent create button 
3. **Enter Details**: Provide a descriptive title and optional description
4. **Set Privacy**: Choose between private, shared, or public visibility
5. **Create & Start**: Click "Create" to set up your new research workspace

### üí° Best Practices

- **Use Descriptive Titles**: "Machine Learning Research 2024" vs "My Notebook"
- **Include Context**: Add project codes, dates, or team names when relevant
- **Consistent Structure**: Develop a naming convention across projects
- **Topic-Based**: Create separate notebooks for distinct research areas

## Notebook Management

Once created, notebooks offer comprehensive management capabilities:
