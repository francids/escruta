# Notebooks

Notebooks are the foundation of research organization in Escruta. They serve as centralized workspaces where you can collect sources, take notes, and organize all materials related to a specific project or topic.

- Upload and organize research sources
- Take and organize notes  
- Have AI-powered conversations about your content
- Generate study materials and summaries

## Creating a Notebook

1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click the "New Notebook" button
3. Enter a title and description for your notebook
4. Choose privacy settings (private or shared)
5. Click "Create" to set up your new workspace

## Managing Notebooks

Once created, you can:

- **Edit Details**: Update the title, description, and settings
- **Add Sources**: Upload documents, add web links, or import content
- **Create Notes**: Take notes directly within the notebook
- **Generate Content**: Use AI tools to create summaries, mind maps, and more
- **Share**: Invite collaborators or make the notebook public

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive titles for easy identification
- Organize content with tags and categories
