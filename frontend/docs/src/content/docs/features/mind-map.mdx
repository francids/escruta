# Mind Map

Transform your research into visual mind maps that illustrate connections, hierarchies, and relationships between concepts. The Mind Map feature uses AI to automatically generate interactive visualizations of your content.

## What are Mind Maps?

Mind maps are visual representations of information that show:

- **Hierarchical Relationships**: How concepts relate to each other
- **Topic Connections**: Links between different ideas and themes
- **Information Structure**: The organization of your research content
- **Key Concepts**: Important terms and ideas highlighted visually

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore concepts through interactive, zoomable mind maps
- **AI-Generated**: Automatically create maps from your research content
- **Customizable**: Adjust colors, layouts, and visual styling
- **Export Options**: Save as images or interactive HTML for sharing

## Generating Mind Maps

### From Notebooks
1. Open your notebook
2. Navigate to "Generate" â†’ "Mind Map"
3. Select content sources (documents, notes, or both)
4. Choose map complexity level
5. Set visualization preferences
6. Click "Generate Mind Map"

### From Individual Sources
1. Open a source document
2. Click the "Mind Map" button in the toolbar
3. Choose focus areas or use full document
4. Select visualization style
5. Generate and view the interactive map

## Customization Options

### Visual Styling
- **Color Schemes**: Choose from predefined themes or create custom colors
- **Node Shapes**: Select different shapes for different concept types
- **Layout Algorithms**: Tree, radial, force-directed, or hierarchical layouts
- **Font Settings**: Adjust text size and font family

### Content Control
- **Complexity Level**: Simple overview or detailed comprehensive maps
- **Topic Filtering**: Include or exclude specific topics
- **Relationship Types**: Show different types of connections
- **Depth Levels**: Control how many levels of relationships to display

## Use Cases

### Academic Research
- **Literature Reviews**: Visualize relationships between research papers
- **Thesis Planning**: Map out argument structure and evidence
- **Concept Exploration**: Discover connections between different theories
- **Study Aids**: Visual study guides for complex subjects

### Professional Projects
- **Project Planning**: Map project components and dependencies
- **Knowledge Mapping**: Visualize expertise areas and gaps
- **Presentation Prep**: Create visual aids for presentations
- **Team Collaboration**: Share visual project overviews

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic maps and add complexity gradually
- **Regular Updates**: Regenerate maps as your research evolves
- **Focus Topics**: Create separate maps for different themes
- **Use Colors Consistently**: Develop a consistent color coding system
- **Review Connections**: Verify AI-generated relationships for accuracy
